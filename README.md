# **Task : Cloud Telephony API Development (Scoped Version)**
## **Description:** 
You are tasked with building a simplied set of APIs for a cloud telephony company. The APIs will allow users to manage virtual phone numbers by creating and retrieving them. You should use a web programming framework (such as fastAPI framework) in Python and choose either REST or GraphQL as the API protocol.
## **Requirements:**
Design and create the necessary database models for the following entities:
+ User: Represents a user of the cloud telephony platform.
+ VirtualPhoneNumber: Represents a virtual phone number owned by a user.
+ CallLog: Represents a log of phone calls made or received by a virtual phone number.

Implement the following API endpoints:
+ Endpoint 1: Retrieve a list of virtual phone numbers owned by a user.
+ Endpoint 2: Create a new virtual phone number for a user.

## Evaluation: 
Candidates should provide a solution that includes the following:
- Database models representing the User and VirtualPhoneNumber entities.
- API endpoints implemented using the chosen web programming framework (REST or GraphQL).
- Proper request/response handling and basic validation.
- Clear and organized code structure with appropriate comments.

You will be evaluated on the quality and correctness of the code, adherence to best practices, consideration for scalability, agility and modularity, and overall approach to the task.
